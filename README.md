# Weather

This is a simple weather app built with (first time using) [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)

## To run locally

Get an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). Then create a 'constants.js' file under the /src/ folder and type:

```
const key = 'YOUR API KEY';

export default key;
```

replacing '**YOUR API KEY**' with your API key you just got. Save that file and run `npm i` followed by `npm start` and you should be up and running!
